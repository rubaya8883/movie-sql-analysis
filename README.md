# üé¨ Movie SQL Analysis: Box Office & Ratings Insights 

This project explores and analyzes a movie dataset using both **Python (Pandas)** for data cleaning and **SQL** for data querying. The goal is to uncover trends and insights about box office collections, IMDb ratings, and other key attributes of movies.

## üßº Step 1: Data Cleaning (Python & Pandas)

Key cleaning steps included:

- Gaining an initial understanding of the dataset structure and value types  
- Identifying missing values across all columns  
- Detecting and removing duplicate rows; standardizing column names for consistency  
- Dropping rows where more than 6 columns contained null values  
- Filling missing values with `'Unknown'` for the `director`, `cast`, and `imdb_genre` columns  
- Replacing null values in the `time_minute` column with a default runtime of **60 minutes**  
- Analyzing missing values in the `votes`, `box_office_collection`, `imdb_rating`, and `metascore` columns using descriptive statistics  
- Filling those numerical missing values using **median values grouped by genre**

---

## üß† Step 2: SQL Analysis

Using SQL queries in Python to explore:
- Top-rated movies by IMDb score
- Revenue trends across genres
- Count of movies per year
- Average IMDb Rating by Year
- Low-rated but high-earning movies ‚Äî Identifies movies with IMDb rating < 6.0 but earned over $100M worldwide
- Top genres by movie count ‚Äî Shows which genres are most represented in the dataset

## üìä Visualizations

Bar charts and line graphs were created using SQL + Pandas + Matplotlib to support each query insight.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- SQLite
- SQL (via 'sqlite3')
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## üí° Key Learning & Purpose

The project was built as part of my portfolio to showcase:
- Proficiency in data wrangling and preprocessing with Pandas 
- Ability to build and query a SQL database
- Data storytelling using Python and SQL
- Preparing datasets for real-world analytics scenarios

---

## üìå Future Work

- Expand to a multi-table relational project (e.g., including actors, directors)
- Add more complex joins, aggregations, and visualizations
