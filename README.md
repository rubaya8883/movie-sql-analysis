# üé¨ Movie SQL Analysis: Box Office & Ratings Insights 

This project explores and analyzes a movie dataset using both **Python (Pandas)** for data cleaning and **SQL** for data querying. The goal is to uncover trends and insights about box office collections, IMDb ratings, and other key attributes of movies.

## üßº Step 1: Data Cleaning (Python & Pandas)

Key cleaning steps included:
- Understanding the whole dataset.
- Finding missing values for each columns.
- Checking duplicates and standardizing column names.
- Droping rows where more than 6 columns contains null values.
- Filling missing values with 'unknown' for director, cast and genre column.
- Replacing null values for time_minute column with 60 minutes.
- Analyzing missing values of votes, box_office_collection, rating, metascore column using descriptive statistics method.
- Handling missing values of votes, box_office_collection, rating, metascore column using median values by genre.

## üß† Step 2: SQL Analysis

Using SQL queries in Python to explore:
- Top-rated movies by IMDb score
- Revenue trends across genres
- Count of movies per year
- Movies with low rating but high revenue
- Correlation patterns (e.g., rating vs. revenue)

---

## üìä Visualizations

Bar charts and line graphs were created using `matplotlib` and `pandas` to visualize:
- Top 10 movies by IMDb rating
- Box office collection trends by genre
- Average rating per release year

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- SQLite
- SQL (via 'sqlite3')
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## üí° Key Learning & Purpose

The project was built as part of my portfolio to showcase:
- Data wrangling skills in Pandas
- Ability to build and query a SQL database
- Data storytelling using Python and SQL
- Preparing datasets for real-world analytics scenarios

---

## üìå Future Work

- Expand to a multi-table relational project (e.g., including actors, directors)
- Add more complex joins, aggregations, and visualizations
